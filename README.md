# node-typescript-seed-2

NodeJS Typescript Starter

# Usage

- Typescript installed locally (not globally) so we use an npm script to run the compiler
- `npm run tsc -- -w`

# Tests

- Single run testing, also this is your basic CI/CD script for testing. If this exits with a 0, then tests are good (including code coverage).
- `npm test`
- Development testing mode
- `npm run test:watch`
- View the HTML coverage report in a Brave browser (change to suit your browser)
- `npm run view:coverage`
